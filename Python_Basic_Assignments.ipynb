    "#Q1.explain the key features of python that make it a popular choice of programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Python is a highly popular programming language. Several key features contribute to its widespread adoption:\n",
    "1. Readability and Simplicity\n",
    "Clean Syntax: Pythonâ€™s syntax is clear and easy to understand, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike. \n",
    "Indentation: Python uses indentation to define the structure of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Versatility\n",
    "General-Purpose Language: Python is not limited to a specific domain and can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more.\n",
    "Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is available on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Interpreted Language: \n",
    "Python code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "\n",
    " Variables in Python are not explicitly typed, allowing flexibility in coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Extensive Libraries: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a vast standard library and many third-party libraries, supporting tasks like web development, data analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Cross-Platform Compatibility: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python runs on various operating systems without requiring changes to the code.\n",
